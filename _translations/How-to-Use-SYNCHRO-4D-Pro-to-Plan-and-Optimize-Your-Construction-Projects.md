## How to import your design models from various formats
 
One of the advantages of SYNCHRO 4D Pro is that it supports a wide range of design formats, such as DWG, DGN, IFC, RVT, and more. You can import your design models from different sources and combine them into a single project. To import your design models, follow these steps:

1. Open SYNCHRO 4D Pro and create a new project or open an existing one.
2. Click on the Import button on the ribbon and select the format of your design model.
3. Browse to the location of your design file and select it.
4. Choose the options for importing your model, such as units, scale, orientation, and coordinate system.
5. Click on OK to start the import process.
6. Repeat the steps for any other design models you want to import.

Once you have imported your design models, you can view them in the 3D window and use the tools on the ribbon to manipulate them. You can also use the Model Explorer panel to see the hierarchy and properties of your model elements.
  
## How to assign resources, costs, and durations to your tasks
 
After importing your design models, you need to create a schedule for your project. You can use the Schedule panel to create and edit your tasks. You can also assign resources, costs, and durations to your tasks to estimate the scope and budget of your project. To assign resources, costs, and durations to your tasks, follow these steps:

1. Select a task in the Schedule panel or in the 3D window.
2. Click on the Resource Assignment button on the ribbon.
3. In the Resource Assignment dialog box, click on the Add button to create a new resource or select an existing one from the list.
4. Enter the name, type, quantity, rate, and availability of your resource.
5. Click on OK to assign the resource to your task.
6. Repeat the steps for any other resources you want to assign to your task.

You can also use the Cost Assignment button on the ribbon to assign costs to your tasks. You can enter fixed or variable costs for your tasks and specify how they are calculated. You can also use the Duration Assignment button on the ribbon to assign durations to your tasks. You can enter fixed or variable durations for your tasks and specify how they are calculated.
  
## How to link your tasks to your model elements
 
The next step is to link your tasks to your model elements. This will allow you to create a 4D model that shows how your project will be built over time. You can use the Link Task button on the ribbon to link your tasks to your model elements. To link your tasks to your model elements, follow these steps:

1. Select a task in the Schedule panel or in the 3D window.
2. Click on the Link Task button on the ribbon.
3. In the Link Task dialog box, select one or more model elements from the Model Explorer panel or from the 3D window.
4. Click on OK to link your task to your model elements.
5. Repeat the steps for any other tasks you want to link to your model elements.

Once you have linked your tasks to your model elements, you can use the Timeline panel to see how your project will progress over time. You can also use the Simulation button on the ribbon to play a 4D animation of your project.
